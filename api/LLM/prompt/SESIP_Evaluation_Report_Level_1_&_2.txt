Security Target (ST) Evaluation Report (SESIP 1 & 2)

A SESIP Level 1 and 2 evaluation should contain 31 work units (ASE_INT.1.1~1-11, ASE_OBJ.1-1, ASE_REQ.3-1~3-7, ASE_TSS.1-1~1-2, ALC_FLR.2-1~2-10). Make sure the response contains all the work units. Please make sure they are all in the Work_Units array if it is a SESIP Level 1 or SESIP Level 2 evaluation.
The sum of the elements in Work_Units_Evaluation_Result_Passes_Failed_Numbers_Status (pass and fail) for SESIP 1 or SESIP 2 should be 31.

Evaluation Basis & Documentation
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) was evaluated on the basis of the Security Evaluation Standard for IoT Platform (SESIP), Common Criteria [CC] and Methodology [CEM].

The objective of this evaluation was to determine
• Why and how the requirements of the above evaluation aspects are fulfilled by the provided documentation and the TOE, or
• Whether and why the provided documentation does not comply with the requirements and features errors and inconsistencies that are inherent or exist in relation to other documents.

Evaluator Verdicts
The following references contained in [CEM] describe the possible verdicts, which may result from the evaluations to which the object of inspection was subjected.

CEM, Section 8.2.5
The evaluator assigns verdicts to the requirements of the CC and not to those of the CEM. The most granular CC structure to which a verdict is assigned is the evaluator action element (explicit or implied). A verdict is assigned to an applicable CC evaluator action element as a result of performing the corresponding CEM action and its constituent work units. Finally, an evaluation result is assigned, as described in CC Part 1, Chapter 10, Evaluation results.
The CEM recognises three mutually exclusive verdicts states:
    (a)	Conditions for a pass verdict are defined as an evaluator completion of the CC evaluator action element and determination that the requirements for the PP, ST or TOE under evaluation are met. The conditions for passing the element are defined as:
        (1) the constituent work units of the related CEM action, and;
        (2) all evaluation evidence required for performing these work units is coherent, that is it can be fully and completely understood by the evaluator, and
        (3) all evaluation evidence required for performing these work units does not have any obvious internal inconsistencies or inconsistencies with other evaluation evidence. Note that obvious means here that the evaluator discovers this inconsistency while performing the work units: the evaluator should not undertake a full consistency analysis across the entire evaluation evidence every time a work unit is performed.
    (b)	Conditions for a fail verdict are defined as an evaluator completion of the CC evaluator action element and determination that the requirements for the PP, ST, or TOE under evaluation are not met, or that the evidence is incoherent, or an obvious inconsistency in the evaluation evidence has been found;; 
    (c)	All verdicts are initially inconclusive and remain so until either a pass or fail verdict is assigned.
The overall verdict is pass if and only if all the constituent verdicts are also pass. 

Evaluation Results
Evaluation Result Summary
    The submitted object of inspection is assigned the overall verdict pass, which means that all requirements for the evaluation of the individual components are met.
Assessments
    Each single element related to the evaluator actions according to [SESIP] and [CC] are dealt with sequentially, taking into consideration the evaluator work units as specified in [CEM]. The assessment of content and presentation of evidence elements is realized in accordance with the requirements listed.
    The evaluation was carried out by informally analyzing the manufacturer documents according to the relevant work units described in [CEM]. In parallel to these analyses, there are always checks for inconsistencies within a document and in its relation with other documents. In case of any outstanding explicit requirement elements, the results of such a check will only be given if inconsistencies are detected. In addition, errors found out during the evaluation of the work units are listed, too.
    The results in these sections are listed in bold-faced type.

In the following, the assessments of the different evaluator actions and of the subordinate evaluator work units are given.
